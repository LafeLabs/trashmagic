## Shapes

To make these, download the files and then use them in a laser cutter or upload them to www.ponoko.com to get them made there.  For Ponoko you need vector graphics(.svg) with cutouts in one layer and etch in the other.  Be sure to make the width 6 inches for the rulers, and also 6 inches for the full shape set pattern.

## Skeletron

Find bamboo groves or drift wood or similar sticks, cut to 6 foot lengths.  Drill 1/4 inch holes a few inches in from each end and also in the center of the stick.  Wrap in duct tape in rainbow stripes as shown. This is called the Trash Pole.

purchase large quantities of black nylon parachute cord and also clothesline.  Cut clothesline into lengths of 6 feet and wrap ends with duct tape to prevent fraying.  Cut nylon parachute cord into 18 inch segments, and burn each end with a lighter.

Use small ties to tie ends to create structures.  These can be used to make a simple tripod from which hang all the various elements of Trash Robot in bags.  The larger ties can be used to tie things together, tie things to objects, in the sigil boards documented elsewhere, for draw strings for large bags as well as the [ArtBox](scrolls/box.md).  Using small ties to tie together sticks at their ends can be used to make the [octahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octahedron), [tetrahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahedron), and combinations of them to build up structures.  Those structures can be wrapped with blankets and tarps to make modular habitable shelters both for living and working as Trash Robt scales.

This structural system is based on the principle of [tensegrity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensegrity), a term coined by [Buckminster Fuller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckminster_Fuller), a primary influence in this work.

## Textiles

There are two types of textile products used in the Trash Robot system: flags and bags.

In all cases the raw materials are [black cotton flannel](https://www.joann.com/comfy-cozy-flannel-fabric-solids/16681074.html) or some similar equivalent found in a waste stream, [felt sheet](https://www.joann.com/craft-felt-fabric-72-solids/407288.html) of the rainbow colors plus black and white, and trash ties of both length(6 feet of clothesline terminated with duct tape and 18 inches of nylon parachute cord terminated in burned ends), the same as are used in [skeletron](scrolls/skeletron).

![](https://i.imgur.com/iGGA1of.jpg)


Flags are created by cutting a square of black cloth 38 inches on a side, then folding the edges and sewing a hem 1 inch in.  Then the hem is cut in several places along the line, approximately every 3 to 6 inches to allow the flags to be tied to things. The Trash Robot Font is used to create letters which are sewn onto the flag.  One side has "TRASH ROBOT" as shown, the other has whatever domain name is being used to point to the local Trash Robot network node.  Letters cycle through the colors of the rainbow, and generally start as squares either 3 or 4 inches on a side.


Flags are used for advertising, branding, and also as a surface on which all the other physical media and technology can be displayed, as a black background which matches the look and feel of the digital layer of the system.

Bags are used to store tokens and other elements of the clay art system which the robot prints in, to store the robots, to store the Raspberry Pi Trash Robot Terminals, and other technological artifacts created in the Trash Robot system.  Bags come in different sizes and have some standard patterns shown here.  Symbols are sewn in felt on bags to indicate what their purpose and contents are.  Specific symbols with patterns which can be created with a Geometron Shape Set are used for the robot bag, terminal bag, and the bags of clay corresponding to the "earth", "fire" and "water" elements.  These are shown below.
