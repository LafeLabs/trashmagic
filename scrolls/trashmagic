# Trash Magic
 
Magic is the replication of the desire to replicate something.  If someone builds something out of trash which someone else wants to copy, and which will lead to still more people copying it, that's trash magic.  

We will build a world of both comfort and adventure from the waste streams of the old world.  We will use the trash we find everywhere to build all the things of a good life right where we are.  We will power this technology only with the sun, wind and water.  We will abolish all mining, oil, and gas by 2050.
