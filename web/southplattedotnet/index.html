<p>First quest of south platte dot net: Distribute stars which are physical hyperlinks back to the full replication code, use these to map out the primary portal at Colfax and the South Platte River.  Spread trash magic. </p>

<h1>THIS INSTANCE OF SOUTH PLATTE IS ON THE DUMP DIRECTOR HEADLESS PI</h1>
<p>
    The purpose of Trash Magic is to create a civilization of free things entirely built from trash.  We will build things from trash, share them freely, and share how to build them with others so that they can replicate.  We call this replication from person to person of the knowhow and desire to make things "magic".  
</p>

<p>In the recursive web everything replicates, everything evolves, and everything dies.  We create and destroy WORLDS for QUESTS.  QUESTS are for the growth and evolution of TRASH MAGIC.</p>

<p>TRASH MAGIC is a game centered on shared physical places where we co-create a world of things which are made from trash that provide all things to all people in that place.  Write QUESTS and share them.  Run QUESTS and evolve them.  Destroy bad QUESTS</p>


<p>THE RECURSIVE WEB IS MADE OF WORLDS AND QUESTS. YOU CONSTRUCT, REPLICATE AND DESTROY WORLDS AND QUESTS TO BUILD TRASH MAGIC.</p>

<h1>QUESTS OF THE SOUTH PLATTE</h1>

<p>the over-arching quest of which all the other quests are sub-quests for south platte dot net is to build full trash magic along the length of the South Platte River from its origins to the South of Denver Colorado to the confluence with the North Platte in North Platte, Nebraska.  This starts with finding spaces along the river where trash magicians can exchange trash magic self-replicating media made from trash.  These might be called stations, camps, feeds, markers, portals, free stores, carts, or nodes.</p>


<p>
    TRASH ROBOT is fabricating media from cardboard trash using the geometry of the GOLDEN RATIO.  
</p>

<p>trash star portals have been added to the river.  One portal is along the pedestrian bridge over the river just south of the i-25 bridge.  One is by the bit painting just up from the sandy beach at the south east corner of the confluence between the river and cherry creek, and another is directly above that point along the path with the overlook, on the manhole cover.  trash magci stars are just 5 pointed stars cut out from cardboard, with star fractals, trash magic symbol, and QR code to the trash magic replicator code.</p>


<p>
    what will we do with these portals? create self-replicating media from cardboard and other trash, distribute via portals, move from one to another, grow the physical network.

<h1>GENERAL QUESTS</h1>

<p>
build a trash magic server, publish a zine on it. Become a zine publisher for your neighborhood, with each zine pointing to the domain which points to the server where you publish the zines.
</p>

<p>
    build a second trash magic server and convert it to a DUMP DIRECTOR so you can host multiple locations of the recursive web.  Build recursive web pages and recruit more trash magicians to create more worlds and quests.
</p>

<p>
    create self-replicating Platonic Solids from trash and replicate them out on the street. keep changing the design and location of the solids until they replicate freely.  change how you engage them into commerical social media, trying to make the constructions go viral until they do.  when they do, deliberately evolve the system to consume trash in the most efficient manner and to make constructions which can be used for modular assembly of larger more complex technolgoy.   
</p>

<p>
    create self-replicating tensegrity constructions from sticks and other narrow and straight objects from trash found in the environment.  If you can make a tetrahedron, you can make an octahedron and if you can make that you can make an icosahedron and if you can make that you can build up whole arcologies of trash.  Start with just self-relpicating sticks in tripods and evolve upward as it starts to self-replicate.  These skeletron constructions can be 
</p>

<h1>WORLDS</h1>

<p>worlds are shared. some are fantasy and some are material.  we divide the world roughly into the WATERSHED and the STREET.  The WATERSHED consists of the flows of water through the world, and the STREET is all the shared human spaces like streets, parking lots, parks, libraries, shopping centers, and public buildings of all kinds.  The worlds we build are all to set context for the quests, which take place in worlds.  These can overlap, with any quest being doable in any world.</p>
