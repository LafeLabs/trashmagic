<p>
Trash Magic is a set consisting of elements. Yes, it is an element of itself. Zermelo and Fraenkel are dead.  We are constructing a new theory and praxis of sets based on our intent to create self-replicating systems.  We discard all of the axioms of set theory from Zermelo-Fraenkel and related systems.  We aim not to make statements which are "true" in the absolute sense sought by classical mathematicians, but to make statements which "work" in that making those statements help us to create trash magic.  Hence sets may contain themselves and each other as we choose for convenience to better communicate ideas to other people about replication.
