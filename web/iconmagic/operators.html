<p>
The Trash Magic Network consists not of machines but of people.  Operators operate servers. They get servers from hackers and media from the Community and distribute that media back to the rest of the Community.  Media can include trash of all kinds, including cardboard trash to write on and laptop trash to install Servers on.
