    <h1>TRASH MAGIC RECURSIVE WEB</h1>


<p>
    The purpose of Trash Magic is to create a civilization of free things entirely built from trash.  We will build things from trash, share them freely, and share how to build them with others so that they can replicate.  We call this replication from person to person of the knowhow and desire to make things "magic".  
</p>

<p>THE RECURSIVE WEB IS MADE OF WORLDS AND QUESTS. YOU CONSTRUCT, REPLICATE AND DESTROY WORLDS AND QUESTS TO BUILD TRASH MAGIC.</p>

<h1>QUESTS</h1>

<p>
build a trash magic server, publish a zine on it. Become a zine publisher for your neighborhood, with each zine pointing to the domain which points to the server where you publish the zines.
</p>

<p>
    build a second trash magic server and convert it to a DUMP DIRECTOR so you can host multiple locations of the recursive web.  Build recursive web pages and recruit more trash magicians to create more worlds and quests.
</p>

<p>
    A dump is a place with servers behind a dump director( computer) which can direct traffic to multiple trash servers from multiple domains.  Dumps are spaces where a trash macician controls the router and internet connection so that it can be used as a place for hosing servers.  Dumps can be on raw land in rural areas, all we need is an Internet connection.  Trash magicians can move onto a piece of land, crowd fund a connection and the hardware to build off grid power, and start taking in old hardware to make into trash servers and running recursive web and also trash magic servers.  the recursive web has quests to create more dumps, making the dumps self-replicating.
</p>

<p>
    create self-replicating Platonic Solids from trash and replicate them out on the street. keep changing the design and location of the solids until they replicate freely.  change how you engage them into commerical social media, trying to make the constructions go viral until they do.  when they do, deliberately evolve the system to consume trash in the most efficient manner and to make constructions which can be used for modular assembly of larger more complex technolgy.   
</p>

<p>
    create self-replicating tensegrity constructions from sticks and other narrow and straight objects from trash found in the environment.  If you can make a tetrahedron, you can make an octahedron and if you can make that you can make an icosahedron and if you can make that you can build up whole arcologies of trash.  Start with just self-relpicating sticks in tripods and evolve upward as it starts to self-replicate.  These skeletron constructions can be integrated into the shopping cart ecosystem of the STREET.
</p>



<h1>WORLDS</h1>

<p>worlds are shared. some are fantasy and some are material.  we divide the world roughly into the WATERSHED and the STREET.  The WATERSHED consists of the flows of water through the world, and the STREET is all the shared human spaces like streets, parking lots, parks, libraries, shopping centers, and public buildings of all kinds.  The worlds we build are all to set context for the quests, which take place in worlds.  These can overlap, with any quest being doable in any world.</p>
