    <h1>TRASH MAGIC RECURSIVE WEB</h1>

    <h1>RHOMBI DOT XYZ</h1>

<p>
    The purpose of Trash Magic is to create a civilization of free things entirely built from trash.  We will build things from trash, share them freely, and share how to build them with others so that they can replicate.  We call this replication from person to person of the knowhow and desire to make things "magic".  
</p>

<p>THE RECURSIVE WEB IS MADE OF PORTALS AND QUESTS. YOU CONSTRUCT, REPLICATE AND DESTROY PORTALS AND QUESTS TO BUILD TRASH MAGIC.</p>


<h1>QUEST OF THE RHOMBI</h1>

<p>
    Replicate the rhombi from cardboard trash. Print out the QR codes and put them on the rhombi.  Rhombi are using 36 degree and 144 degree angles, which are a Penrose Tiling.  Rhombi can be cut to make 2 Golden Triangles for replication of trash magic STARS and ROCK STARS. ROCK STARS are stars cut from cardboard combined with rocks. ROCK. STAR.  Keep replicating rhombi and using them to relicate stars and use stars to replicate triangles and triangles to replicate everything.  Replicate the compost cube using cardboard cubes cut out with the GEOMETRON cube design, free compost from a compost place, and self-replicating potatoes.
