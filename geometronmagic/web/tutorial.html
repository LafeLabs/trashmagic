    <h1>TRASH MAGIC WEB TUTORIAL</h1>

<p>
First go to the link below, open sloanslake dot art in a separate browser window so you can see this guide and scroll down.
</p>

<p>...scroll down until you see the link for "WEB" and click on that:</p>

<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LafeLabs/trashmagic/main/media/trashmagic/webpage2.png"/>

<p>scroll down until you see the trash robot home page and click on that to see what it looks like</p>

<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LafeLabs/trashmagic/main/media/trashmagic/webpage3.png"/>

<p>It has a title, a paragraph, and some links.  Remember this format.  And click the "HOME" link to go back to the main WEB page.</p>

<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LafeLabs/trashmagic/main/media/trashmagic/webpage4.png"/>

<p>click the link to the "CODE EDITOR"</p>

<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LafeLabs/trashmagic/main/media/trashmagic/webpage5.png"/>

<p>The code editor is part of our system of self-editing code. You are editing the home page live here.  There are no users, no logins, no passwords, no databases, no private data, and no fixed permanent files. Everything can be edited, copied, or deleted by anyone at any time.  this is the esssence of trash magic, a system without property which exists for the sole purpose of sharing self-replicating media.  Code is in the lower left, the files we are editing are in the lower right, the file name is top center, a new filename is entered right below that, and links are in the upper right corner.</p>

<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LafeLabs/trashmagic/main/media/trashmagic/webpage6.png"/>

<p>think of a name for your new page which can work as a web page, meaning no spaces and only certain characters like _ and - along with letters and numbers. It must end with .html.  For example, if your name is zorak you might put in simply zorak.html or zorakrules.html but not "zorak rules.html".  Put that name into the "new file name" field and hit "enter" to create your new file with that name which will be a copy of index.html the main home page.</p>

<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LafeLabs/trashmagic/main/media/trashmagic/webpage7.png"/>

<p>we are now entering the world of HTML, which is short for Hyper Text Markup Language.  If you have not interacted before with "code" do not fear!! This is not the bad kind of code. THink of it more like punctuation.  You know how to use quotes, commas and periods to mark up your text to make it make more sense, and this is sort of an extension of that.  Just as sentences are terminated by a period and started by a capital letter, we have in web layout opening and closing "tags" which create "elements" much like sentences and paragraphs.</p>

<p>we begin with the heading tag h1.  H is for heading and the 1 denotes the BIGGEST type of heading, which is the only one we use in TRASH MAGIC web design. HTML tags are always between the less than and greater than signs, and the closing tag has a forward slash before the symbol/letter, which is case insensitive.  This means that H1 and h1 both work the same. Put the cursor between the tags of the title in your new page and change it to whatever is appropriate, preferably in ALL CAPS for design consistency.  This title will be automatically rainbow-ified by the Trash Magic web code when it appears in a browser.</p>

<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LafeLabs/trashmagic/main/media/trashmagic/webpage8.png"/>

<p>
    The next HTML element we will use is "p" which is for "paragraph".  Paragraphs, like the one this text lives in, are rendered in Trash Magic as blue boxes with white letters. Edit the text to whatever you want, some type of introduction about who you are and what you're all about on your page.  You can add another paragraph by either scrolling down and putting in another p tag(always in between angle brackets) or you can copy/paste the existing paragraph and change that so that you don't have to type the tags again.
</p>

<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LafeLabs/trashmagic/main/media/trashmagic/webpage9.png"/>
<p>
    The third and final type of tag we will use here is the link, which is confusingly an "a" tag. "A" stands for "anchor", and while it might seem more ligical for it to be "L" for link or "H" for hyperlink, "a" is what was chosen and so it remains. This tag is more complex than the other two.   It has something called an "attribute", which in this case is the address that the link is pointing to, which the browser will jump to if a user clicks on the link.  The attribute here is called "href".  It takes a little getting used to, we recommend that you just copy/paste the links and change what's in quotes after href to whatever address you want to link to and change the words between the a opening and closing tags to the text you want.
</p>

<p>Use the link copy/paste procedure to add links to whatever you want, like a link tree.  Put links to your social media, links to contact info, links to home pages, links to pages you like, and links to your friends.  Use simple text, for example you can put in your whole exact web address for your tiktok account but then the text will look simple if it just reads "TIKTOK" in the text.  All these links will also get rainbow-ified by the Trash Magic web code automatically.</p>

<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LafeLabs/trashmagic/main/media/trashmagic/webpage10.png"/>

<p>
When you have made your page how you want it, click on "index.html" in the right lower half of the screen to load that main web file.  Add a link to the list of links to your page. Be sure to use the exact file name! for example, put in "zorak.html" not just "zorak" for the link.  This IS case sensitive, so be sure to get the same case as whatever you used before.
</p>
<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LafeLabs/trashmagic/main/media/trashmagic/webpage11.png"/>
<p>
        Now let's go see what we made by clicking on the "web" link in the upper right corner of the screen.
</p>
<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LafeLabs/trashmagic/main/media/trashmagic/webpage12.png"/>
<p>
    Scroll down to your new page, whatever the text you put in for the link was, and click on that to see your new page.
</p>
<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LafeLabs/trashmagic/main/media/trashmagic/webpage13.png"/>
<p>
    There it is! Hopefully you have a link still there which links back to "HOME" which is "index.html".  Click that to go back home.
</p>
<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LafeLabs/trashmagic/main/media/trashmagic/webpage14.png"/>
<p>
    Now go back to the web code editor and highlight all your code and copy it to your clipboard.  Then paste it into a pastebin at pastebin.com or into a text file using something like notepad you can save as raw text, or drop it into a email or text message.  
</p>
<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LafeLabs/trashmagic/main/media/trashmagic/webpage15.png"/>
<p>If you used pastebin, click on raw to get the raw code link, and send that link to TRASH ROBOT or someone who is an OPERATOR of a SERVER on the TRASH MAGIC MEDIA NETWORK.</p>
<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LafeLabs/trashmagic/main/media/trashmagic/webpage16.png"/>
<p>lastly we must address how to destroy web pages in case a mistake is made. We go back to the web code editor and click the "DESTROYER" link to go to the desroyer.</p>

<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LafeLabs/trashmagic/main/media/trashmagic/webpage17.png"/>

<p>The DESTROYER lists all the files in the web folder, with red "X"'s to delete them.  To delete is forever, there is no undo and no backup.  So always copy good content and copy it again and again. Part of building a free replication based system is that we must be able to very rapidly delete bad information in order to maintain a healthy ecosystem of content.</p>

<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LafeLabs/trashmagic/main/media/trashmagic/webpage18.png"/>

<p>Now that you have made your own page, share it with people, and copy it to other TRASH MAGIC SERVERs.  If you are part of the TRASH MAGIC MEDIA NETWORK, we can put your page in the web directory on the home code repository from which all servers are copied, making infinite copies of your memes.</p>
