<p>
Geometron is a geometric metalanguage. It is a means of constructing languages in which those languages are made of symbols which are made up of sequences of geometric actions, each of which is represented by a symbol and so on. In full Trash Magic we will use Geometron to create both media and manufacturing, controlling the machines that make things and also the machines which express symbols we use for communication.  Geometron is an alternative to the Turing paradigm of so-called "computation", in which the primary purpose of of machines is to carry out geometric constructions, not to manipulate numbers.
